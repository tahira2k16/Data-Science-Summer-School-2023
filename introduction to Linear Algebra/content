How can we run operations and analysis on large quantity of data? We need matrices to represent these data, process the network structure and learning operations to mine for insights.
  Linear Algebra is an essential branch of mathematics to help make running algorithms on massive datasets feasible. 
  This workshop will help you to develop an understanding in this important branch of mathematics for data science.

This workshop will address students who never attended a Linear Algebra course. 
  The aim is to present the mathematical concepts which are a prerequisites for lectures like Mathematics for Data Science (first), Machine Learning and Causal Inference (later).
