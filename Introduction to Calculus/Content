Many data science challenges, particularly those in machine learning and deep learning, are essentially optimisation problems. 
Ever wondered how exactly a logistic regression algorithm is implemented? Or how to use gradient descent? To understand how these methods work, you need to use concepts from Calculus - gradient, derivatives, limits, and chain rule. 
This workshop will help you to develop an understanding in this important branch of mathematics for data science.
